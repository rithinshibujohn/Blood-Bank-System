Annually more than 120,000 units of blood, platelets, and plasma are required to meet the needs of the hospitals we serve, and your blood type is critical in saving the lives of patients in your community.A-positive blood type, or Type A+, is blood that has type A antigens and a positive rhesus (Rh) factor. Antigens and Rh factor are both proteins on the surface of your red blood cells.Knowing your blood type is important for many reasons, including preventing wrong transfusions in emergency situations.Your blood type can increase your risk of certain conditions and lower your risk of others. This is because the characteristics found in the genes responsible for the different blood types are linked to the likelihood of developing other medical conditions."

B+ donors are encouraged to donate whole blood, apheresis red blood cells or platelets.B+ is a rare blood type that holds tremendous power. Only 8% of the population has B+ blood. B+ blood donors have two ways of targeting the power of their donation.The most preferred donation method is to donate platelets. Platelets can be donated as often as every seven days and up to 24 times a year. Platelets are in high demand by hospitals and often help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.Red blood cells from B+ donors also hold lifesaving power. Depending on hospital demand, a OneBlood phlebotomist will advise if a whole blood donation is preferred.B' type blood is characterized by the presence of 'B'-type antigens in the red blood cells and by 'A'-type antibodies in the plasma. As in the case of 'A' or 'O'-type blood, an individual with a 'B' blood type may be Rh+ or Rh-, depending on whether there are Rh proteins on the red blood cells."

Universal Plasma Donor and Universal Red Cell Recipient. The nature of antigens present in the serum determines the blood type.AB Blood Types are known as the ‘Universal Recipient’ because their blood type means that they can receive blood from any donor if they require a transfusion. This interesting fact about AB blood type is a result of the fact that AB blood types are made up of both A and B antigens. Unfortunately for others though, the AB+ blood type can only be donated to other AB+ blood types because of its unique make-up. This doesn’t mean that AB Positive blood is not valuable though, as it is always advised that someone with AB Positive blood should receive it in favor of the other blood types. "

        details:"Why is A negative blood important? A negative red blood cells can be used to treat around 40% of the population. However, A negative platelets are particularly important because they can be given to people from all blood groups. That's why A negative platelets are called the 'universal platelet type'.AB negative is the rarest blood type in the ABO blood group, accounting for just 1% of our blood donors. In total only 3% of donors belong to the AB blood group.All over the world, there are only 1.99% of people who have A negative as their blood type. For those who say that the A negative blood type is not that rare, look again people. Less than 2% of people have this blood type running through their veins. In number terms, this means that only 1.7 million people are A negative, which is an interesting fact about A- Blood Type.Knowing your blood group can prove to be resourceful in times of adversity. You can donate your blood to anyone who needs, be it during an operation or after they have been in an accident. For the most part, you will need to have a good understanding of your blood type, any allergies, or any health conditions that can help the doctors decide whether or not your blood will help the patient or not."

B negative patients can only receive blood from other B negative donors or from type O negative donors (who are the universal donors).Only 2% of the United States population has B Negative blood. B- donors can help change the world by donating blood (called whole blood) .B negative blood is one of the rarest blood types as just 2% of our blood donors have it. In comparison,.Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of two particular antigens (molecules) on the surface of a person's red blood cells, antigens A and B. If the person's blood only has A antigens, it is type A; if it only has B antigens, it is type B. If the person has both antigens, her blood type is AB.AB- blood the rarest blood type, and is also in high demand as it is a universal plasma donation. Since the red blood cells contain both A and B antigens, the plasma (liquid portion of the blood) can be given to all patients because these donors do not make anti-A or anti-B antibodies. These donors are encouraged to give platelets or plasma by apheresis, if possible.The rarest blood type is AB-, which is found in 1% of people. "

Patients with AB negative blood type can receive red blood cells from all negative blood types.AB negative is the rarest blood type in the ABO blood group, accounting for just 1% of our blood donors. AB Negative blood is hemoglobin with no A or B protein chains. Instead, it has two different globin chains that produce red blood cells.The blood type diet as a concept points out that your blood type has a similar effect to how your entire genetic makeup predisposes you to various capacities and shortcomings. According to the blood type diet, the body's reaction to digestive mechanisms, exercise type, and stress depends on one’s blood type. The explanation for this situation, according to D'Adamo, the founder of the blood type diet, is that not all blood types existed collectively throughout history. As a result, people with various blood types should not consume the same foods because of the difference in the availability of different foods at different times and eras. "

Blood is comprised of many vital components, including plasma, red and white blood cells, and platelets. In addition, the blood contains antigens. These substances trigger the body's immune system to attack foreign invaders, such as bacteria.Blood group O-positive (O+) is the most common blood type among Americans.About 43 percent of Americans have an O blood type of which O-positive accounts for about 38 percent of the population."
